# Grade-and-GPA-Calculator
This code is used to calculate the grade of a specific class and to calculate the GPA of a certain number of classes. If the user wants to calculate the specific class, the program will ask about information about the weightings of each grade of the user. Then, the program will print the syllabus and one-by-one go through the types of grades in the class based on the weighting of the grade. After all the calculations, the program will print the contribution of the weighting of the grade and the percentage of each smaller assignment under a weighting. Lastly, the program will print the estimated letter grade and percentage that the user will have in the class overall. If the user wants to calculate the GPA, the user will input all of their class letter grades, and the calculator will convert those letter grades to a certain amount of points that will be added up. After all those points are added up, the points will be divided by the amount of classes that they have to calculate the GPA. Once this is calculated, the program will print the GPA points that the user has. The program will loop until the user types 3 when they are prompted the options that they have ( [1] a class grade, [2] GPA calculator, [3] or to quit).
